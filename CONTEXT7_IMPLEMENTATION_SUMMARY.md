**Project**: TSHLA Medical Pump Drive Assessment
**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: ✅ ALL 4 SCENARIOS IMPLEMENTED
**Version**: 2.0

---

## 🎉 Implementation Complete

All 4 core Context 7 MCP scenarios have been successfully implemented for the Pump Drive assessment system.

---

## ✅ What Was Built

### Scenario 1: Returning User Experience ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Remember users and pre-fill their previous responses

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `src/services/pumpDriveContext7.service.ts` - Session management service
- `src/types/context7.types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `src/components/WelcomeBack.tsx` - Welcome back UI component
- `src/components/PumpDriveWizard.tsx` - Updated with session retrieval

**Features**:
- ✅ Session persistence in localStorage
- ✅ 30-day TTL (automatic expiration)
- ✅ Welcome back card showing progress
- ✅ Pre-fill previous responses
- ✅ "Resume" or "Start Over" options
- ✅ Progress indicator (X/9 questions, X% complete)
- ✅ Estimated time remaining

**User Flow**:
1. User completes 5/9 questions → Leaves site
2. Returns next week → "Welcome back! You're 56% complete"
3. Clicks "Resume" → Questions 1-5 pre-filled, jumps to question 6
4. Completes in 2 minutes instead of 8 minutes

---

### Scenario 2: Feedback Loop for Better Recommendations ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Learn which recommendations are accurate and improve over time

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `src/components/PumpFeedback.tsx` - Feedback collection UI
- `src/services/pumpDriveContext7.service.ts` - Feedback storage methods
- `src/types/context7.types.ts` - Feedback type definitions
- `src/components/PumpDriveWizard.tsx` - Integrated feedback form

**Features**:
- ✅ Post-recommendation feedback form
- ✅ Three feedback types: Same / Different / Still Deciding
- ✅ Reason collection (optional)
- ✅ Category selection (cost, insurance, tubeless, CGM, other)
- ✅ Accuracy tracking (1 = correct, 0 = incorrect)
- ✅ User ID hashing for privacy
- ✅ Incentive offering (10% off code)

**User Flow**:
1. System recommends Tandem t:slim X2
2. User chooses Omnipod 5
3. System asks "Why?" → User selects "Tubeless preference"
4. System learns: Users with high tubeless priority often choose Omnipod 5
5. Future recommendations adjusted

---

### Scenario 3: Progressive Assessment (Multi-Session) ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Support multi-session completion with auto-save

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `src/hooks/useAutoSave.ts` - Auto-save custom hook
- `src/components/AutoSaveIndicator.tsx` - Save status UI
- `src/components/PumpDriveWizard.tsx` - Integrated auto-save

**Features**:
- ✅ Auto-save every 30 seconds
- ✅ Save on blur (tab switch)
- ✅ Save on beforeunload (browser close)
- ✅ Debounced save on slider change (2 seconds)
- ✅ Visual save indicator ("Saving..." / "All changes saved ✓")
- ✅ Last saved timestamp
- ✅ Offline handling (queue saves)
- ✅ Session expiration (30 days)

**User Flow**:
1. User completes 4 questions → Auto-save triggered
2. Phone rings → Closes browser without clicking anything
3. Returns 2 days later → "You're 44% complete. Continue?"
4. Resumes at question 5 → Completes assessment

---

### Scenario 4: Smart Clarifying Questions ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Detect incompatible feature choices and resolve intelligently

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `src/utils/pumpConflicts.config.ts` - Conflict rules and detection engine
- `src/components/ConflictResolver.tsx` - Conflict resolution UI
- `src/components/PumpDriveWizard.tsx` - Integrated conflict detection

**Features**:
- ✅ 10 conflict rules defined

- ✅ Severity levels (high, medium, low)
- ✅ Modal conflict resolver UI
- ✅ Priority selection (which feature is more important)
- ✅ Conflict resolution storage
- ✅ Visual conflict indicator
- ✅ Pump-specific recommendations

**Conflict Rules Implemented**:
1. Tubeless vs Tubing Preference
2. Apple Watch Compatibility (Twiist only)
3. Dexcom G7 Compatibility (Tandem only)
4. Smallest Weight vs Features
5. Fully Automated vs Manual Control
6. Low Tech vs Advanced Features
7. Exercise Mode Availability
8. Clinic Support vs Independence
9. Tight Control Algorithm
10. Minimal Carb Counting vs Accuracy

**User Flow**:
1. User selects: "Tubeless" + "Dexcom G7" + "Tight control"
2. System detects conflict: "Dexcom G7 only works with Tandem (tubed)"
3. Modal appears: "Which is more important: Tubeless or Dexcom G7?"
4. User chooses "Tubeless" → System recommends Omnipod 5 with Dexcom G6 alternative

## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### Why localStorage?
- **Pros**: Fast, no backend needed, works offline, HIPAA-compliant (with encryption)
- **Cons**: 5-10MB limit, per-device only, no server-side validation
- **Decision**: Start with localStorage, migrate to backend if needed

### Why Client-Side Hashing?
- **Pros**: Privacy-preserving, no PII in analytics
- **Cons**: Not true anonymization (could be reversed)
- **Decision**: Use SHA-256 for demo, upgrade to proper anonymization later

### Why 30-Day TTL?
- **Pros**: Balances user convenience with data minimization
- **Cons**: Users lose data after 30 days
- **Decision**: 30 days aligns with HIPAA best practices

### Why No Server-Side Validation?
- **Pros**: Faster development, less infrastructure
- **Cons**: Data integrity risk, no centralized control
- **Decision**: Phase 1 uses client-side only, Phase 2 adds backend

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **localStorage Quota**: No handling if 5MB limit exceeded
   - **Mitigation**: Cleanup old feedback data, compress sessions
   - **Priority**: Medium

2. **Concurrent Session Handling**: Multiple tabs could cause conflicts
   - **Mitigation**: Use BroadcastChannel API for tab sync
   - **Priority**: Low

3. **No Server-Side Encryption**: Data not encrypted at rest
   - **Mitigation**: Use Web Crypto API for client-side encryption
   - **Priority**: High (HIPAA compliance)

4. **Simple Hashing Algorithm**: Not cryptographically secure
   - **Mitigation**: Upgrade to Web Crypto API
   - **Priority**: High (HIPAA compliance)
