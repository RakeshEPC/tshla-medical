## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Single Login Pattern:** All 5 patients logged in exactly once during registration and never returned. This suggests:
   - They may not know they need to complete the assessment
   - Email confirmation may not have clear next steps
   - Assessment link may not be prominent in the interface

2. **Spelling Variations:**
   - Gail Kennedy appears as "Gail Ken" (abbreviated)
   - Suresh Nayak appears as "Suresh Nayek" (alternate spelling)

3. **Duplicate Accounts:**
   - William Watson has two accounts (william@tshla.ai and william44@tshla.ai)
   - Consider consolidating or clarifying which to use

4. **System Performance:**
   - 58 total assessments have been completed by other users
   - System is working correctly for other patients
   - Issue is engagement, not technical
