## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Production:
1. **Privacy Notice Required** (HIPAA compliance)
2. **Test in staging first** (recommended)
3. **Take database backup** (if applicable)
4. **Monitor for 30 minutes post-deploy**

### Known Limitations:
- Uses localStorage (5MB browser limit)
- Client-side only (no server validation yet)
- 30-day session expiration
- Needs encryption for full HIPAA compliance (see HIPAA doc)

---

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### "Welcome Back doesn't show"
→ Check: User is logged in (`AuthContext.user.id` exists)

### "Auto-save not working"
→ Check: Browser console for errors
→ Check: localStorage not full

### "Feedback form missing"
→ Check: `result.topPumps[0].pumpName` exists

### "Conflicts not detected"
→ Check: Slider values are extreme (1 or 10)
