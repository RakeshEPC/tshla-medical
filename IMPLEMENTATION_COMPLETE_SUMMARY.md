# PumpDrive AI Recommendation Engine - Implementation Complete

**Date:** January 6, 2025
**Status:** ✅ CORE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Removed AWS Bedrock Dependency**
- ❌ Uninstalled `aws-sdk` package (12 packages removed)
- ❌ Removed all AWS Bedrock code from [pump-report-api.js](server/pump-report-api.js) (lines 3414-3543)
- ✅ Replaced with OpenAI implementation

### 2. **Installed OpenAI SDK**
```bash
npm install openai@latest
```

### 3. **Environment Configuration**
Updated [.env](.env) file:
```bash
VITE_PRIMARY_AI_PROVIDER=openai

# OpenAI Model Configuration (PumpDrive)
VITE_OPENAI_MODEL_STAGE4=gpt-4o-mini  # Free text analysis (cheap)
VITE_OPENAI_MODEL_STAGE5=gpt-4o       # Context 7 questions (better reasoning)
VITE_OPENAI_MODEL_STAGE6=gpt-4o       # Final AI analysis (best quality)
```

### 4. **Created Complete AI Recommendation Engine**
New file: [server/pump-recommendation-engine-ai.js](server/pump-recommendation-engine-ai.js) (713 lines)

#### Stage 1: Baseline Initialization (40%)
- All 6 pumps start at 40%
- Medtronic 780G, Tandem t:slim X2, Tandem Mobi, Omnipod 5, Beta Bionics iLet, Twiist

#### Stage 2: Slider Adjustments (±12%)
Implemented complete logic for 5 sliders with positive boosts AND negative penalties:
- **Activity Level** (0-10)
- **Tech Comfort** (0-10)
- **Simplicity Preference** (0-10)
- **Discreteness Importance** (0-10)
- **Time Dedication** (0-10)

Example:
```javascript
// Very active users (activity >= 7)
scores['Tandem t:slim X2'] += 6;  // Boost
scores['Tandem Mobi'] += 4;       // Boost
scores['Medtronic 780G'] -= 3;    // PENALTY (bulky)
scores['Beta Bionics iLet'] -= 2; // PENALTY (no activity features)
```

#### Stage 3: Feature Adjustments (±8%)
Complete feature impact matrix with boosts AND penalties for all features:
- **Tubeless Design**: Boosts Omnipod/Twiist, penalties for tubed pumps
- **No Carb Counting**: Major boost iLet (+12), minor boost others
- **Multiple CGM Options**: Boosts Tandem pumps, penalties for single-CGM pumps
- **Small/Discreet**: Boosts Mobi/Twiist, penalties for larger pumps
- **Aggressive Automation**: Boosts 780G/iLet, penalties for manual pumps
- **Water Resistance**: Boosts 780G/Omnipod
- **iPhone Integration**: Boosts Mobi/Omnipod
- **Activity Features**: Boosts Tandem pumps

#### Stage 4: AI Free Text Analysis (+25% max)
**Semantic intent extraction** using OpenAI gpt-4o-mini:
- Understands variations: "I love to swim" → water resistance need
- Not just keyword matching: "Carb counting exhausts me" → carb burnout intent
- AI extracts true intentions and maps to 23 dimensions

Example prompt:
```
Extract TRUE INTENTIONS from patient free text...

EXAMPLES:
"I love to swim" → Intent: Daily swimming (Dim 11) → Medtronic +8, Omnipod +7, Mobi +5
"Carb counting exhausts me" → Intent: Carb burnout (Dim 8) → iLet +8, others +1
"I'm always on the go" → Intent: Active lifestyle (Dim 1) → Mobi +6, t:slim +5
```

#### Stage 5: Context 7 Questions (±5%)
**Smart follow-up question analysis** using OpenAI gpt-4o:
- Only runs if Context 7 data provided
- Analyzes top 3 pumps and refines with small adjustments
- Considers: insurance, support network, lifestyle details, tech integration

#### Stage 6: Final AI Analysis (+20% to top choice)
**Deep reasoning for final choice** using OpenAI gpt-4o:
- Reviews all previous stages holistically
- Can override if #2 is actually better fit despite lower score
- Awards +20% boost to SINGLE best pump
- Provides comprehensive final insights (2-3 sentences)
- Includes key strengths and reasoning

### 5. **Integrated into API**
Modified [server/pump-report-api.js](server/pump-report-api.js):

```javascript
// Line 20: Import new engine
const pumpEngine = require('./pump-recommendation-engine-ai');

// Lines 30-42: Initialize OpenAI client
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY
});

const OPENAI_MODELS = {
  freeText: process.env.VITE_OPENAI_MODEL_STAGE4 || 'gpt-4o-mini',
  context7: process.env.VITE_OPENAI_MODEL_STAGE5 || 'gpt-4o',
  finalAnalysis: process.env.VITE_OPENAI_MODEL_STAGE6 || 'gpt-4o'
};

// Lines 3391-3409: Replace AWS Bedrock with OpenAI
async function generatePumpRecommendations(userData) {
  if (!process.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY || process.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY === 'your_openai_api_key_here') {
    console.log('OpenAI not configured - using rule-based recommendations');
    return generateRuleBasedRecommendations(userData);
  }

  try {
    console.log('=== Using OpenAI-Powered Recommendation Engine ===');
    return await pumpEngine.generatePumpRecommendationsOpenAI(openai, OPENAI_MODELS, userData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in OpenAI recommendation engine:', error);
    console.log('Falling back to rule-based recommendations');
    return generateRuleBasedRecommendations(userData);
  }
}
```
