## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [assessments, setAssessments] = useState<AssessmentSummary[]>([]);
const [selectedForComparison, setSelectedForComparison] = useState<number[]>([]);
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'timeline' | 'comparison'>('timeline');
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### Data Fetching
- Uses `assessmentHistoryService.getCurrentUserAssessments()`
- Fetches on component mount via `useEffect`
- Automatically extracts user ID from JWT token
- Graceful error handling with user feedback

### Selection Logic
```typescript
const toggleSelection = (id: number) => {
  if (selectedForComparison.includes(id)) {
    setSelectedForComparison(prev => prev.filter(i => i !== id));
  } else if (selectedForComparison.length < 3) {
    setSelectedForComparison(prev => [...prev, id]);
  } else {
    alert('You can compare up to 3 assessments at a time');
  }
};
```

### Comparison Insights Algorithm
```typescript
const allSamePump = selectedAssessments.every(
  a => a.recommendedPump === selectedAssessments[0].recommendedPump
);

const avgScore = selectedAssessments.reduce(
  (sum, a) => sum + a.matchScore, 0
) / selectedAssessments.length;

const dates = selectedAssessments
  .map(a => new Date(a.completedAt))
  .sort((a, b) => a.getTime() - b.getTime());
const timeSpan = Math.ceil(
  (dates[dates.length - 1].getTime() - dates[0].getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
);
```
