## 🎉 **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### 1. ✅ Admin Login - WORKING
**Problem**: `admin@tshla.ai` showed "Invalid email or password"
**Root Cause**: Password was not set or forgotten
**Fix Applied**:
- Reset password using Supabase Admin API
- Verified with test login script

**Fix Applied**:
- Added GitHub Secret: `VITE_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`
- Value: `8d226631680379ac8ea48ed0bf73df2c51df453c`
- Triggered manual rebuild
- Verified API key is valid (tested with Deepgram API)

**Result**: ✅ Deepgram API key now baked into production bundle

## 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### If Dictation Still Doesn't Work:

#### 1. Check Browser Console (F12)

**Look for specific errors:**

```
❌ "Deepgram API key not set"
   → Build didn't include the key. Contact support.

❌ "NotAllowedError" or "Permission denied"
   → Microphone blocked. Reset permissions:
   Click lock icon → Site settings → Microphone → Allow

❌ "No microphone detected"
   → Check microphone is connected and not disabled

❌ "WebSocket connection failed" (with 401 error)
   → API key invalid. Check Deepgram console.

❌ "WebSocket connection failed" (with network error)
   → Check internet connection / firewall
```

#### 2. Verify Deepgram API Key in Bundle

Open browser console and run:
```javascript
// This won't work directly, but the string should be in the bundle
// Check Network tab → index-*.js → Search for "api.deepgram.com"
```

Or check the source:
```bash
curl -s "https://www.tshla.ai/assets/index-*.js" | grep -o "api.deepgram.com"
# Should return: api.deepgram.com
```

#### 3. Check Microphone Permissions

Chrome:
1. Click lock icon in address bar
2. Click "Site settings"
3. Find "Microphone"
4. Select "Allow"
5. Refresh page

Safari:
1. Safari menu → Settings → Websites
2. Select "Microphone"
3. Find www.tshla.ai
4. Select "Allow"

#### 4. Test in Different Browser

- ✅ Chrome (best support)
- ✅ Edge (Chromium-based, good)
- ⚠️ Firefox (good, but different API)
- ⚠️ Safari (some limitations)

#### 5. Check Deepgram Quota

1. Go to: https://console.deepgram.com
2. Check usage dashboard
3. Verify you haven't hit limits
4. Check billing/credits
