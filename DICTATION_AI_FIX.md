# Dictation "Process with AI" Fix

## Problem
The "Process with AI" button in the dictation service was not working because:

1. **Missing Service File**: The `ai.service.ts` file was archived to `_archived_2025_cleanup/` but `DictationBox.tsx` was still trying to import from it
2. **Invalid API Endpoint**: The old service was trying to call `/api/note` which doesn't exist
3. **Broken Integration**: The service wasn't integrated with the actual Azure OpenAI service

## Solution Applied

### 1. Restored ai.service.ts
- Copied the service from `src/services/_archived_2025_cleanup/ai.service.ts` to `src/services/ai.service.ts`
- This fixes the import error in `DictationBox.tsx`

### 2. Updated to Use Azure OpenAI Directly
Modified the `processToSOAP` method to:
- Import and use `azureAIService` from `./azureAI.service`
- Call `azureAIService.processMedicalTranscription()` directly instead of making API calls
- Convert the Azure AI result format to the SOAP format expected by DictationBox

### 3. Code Changes Made

**File**: `src/services/ai.service.ts`

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Added imports
import { azureAIService } from './azureAI.service';

// Updated processToSOAP to use Azure AI directly
const result = await azureAIService.processMedicalTranscription(
  transcript,
  patientData,
  options.template || null,
  additionalContext
);

// Added conversion method
private convertToSOAPNote(result: any, patient: any, visitDate: string): SOAPNote {
  // Converts Azure AI ProcessedNote format to SOAPNote format
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. User records dictation in DictationBox
2. Clicks "Process with AI" button
3. `DictationBox.tsx` calls `aiService.processToSOAP()`
4. `ai.service.ts` forwards to `azureAIService.processMedicalTranscription()`
5. Azure OpenAI processes the transcript (or falls back to AWS Bedrock/Standard OpenAI)
6. Result is converted to SOAP format and returned to UI
7. SOAP note is displayed in the interface

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to a page with dictation (check which pages use DictationBox)
3. Record or type some dictation
4. Click "Process with AI" button
5. Verify that:
   - No console errors appear
   - Processing status shows
   - SOAP note is generated and displayed
   - Note contains proper sections (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan)

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in `.env`:

### Option 1: Azure OpenAI (Recommended - HIPAA Compliant)
```
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://tshla-openai-prod.openai.azure.com/
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=your-key-here
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-01
```

### Option 2: Standard OpenAI (Fallback)
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
VITE_OPENAI_MODEL_STAGE5=gpt-4o
```

### Option 3: AWS Bedrock (Secondary Fallback)
```
VITE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
VITE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
VITE_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```
