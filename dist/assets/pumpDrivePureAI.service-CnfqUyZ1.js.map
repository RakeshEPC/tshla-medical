The personal preferences are very pump specific - rank those pumps higher. Process what they say in their story text as PRIMARY guidance.\n\nCLARIFICATION DECISION:\n- If user priorities clearly point to ONE pump → return empty clarifying questions\n- If top 2-3 pumps score within 10% of each other → ask 2-3 specific questions\n- If user has CONFLICTING priorities (e.g., \"lightest\" + \"most aggressive\") → ask which matters MORE\n\nResponse format:\n{\n  \"analysis\": \"Brief analysis of user preferences\",\n  \"topCandidates\": [\"pump1\", \"pump2\", \"pump3\"],\n  \"clarifyingQuestions\": [\"Question 1?\", \"Question 2?\"] or []\n}`;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Build prompt for final recommendation\n   */\n  private buildFinalRecommendationPrompt(inputData: UserInputData): string {\n    return `You are an expert diabetes educator.

Twiist: 87 mg/dL (LOWEST standard target)\n  2. Beta Bionics iLet: 60 mg/dL (only in special \"lower than usual\" mode)\n  3. Medtronic 780G: 100 mg/dL (fixed aggressive target)\n- If user wants \"lowest target glucose\" → strongly consider Twiist first\n\nCONTROL TIGHTNESS/AGGRESSIVENESS:\n- \"Tightest control\" or \"most aggressive\" means:\n  1. Medtronic 780G: 100% correction (vs 60% for others) - MOST AGGRESSIVE\n  2. Twiist: Aggressive microbolus-like basal modulations\n  3. Others: Standard 60% correction approach\n- For \"best control\" consider BOTH algorithm aggressiveness AND target flexibility\n\nTECHNOLOGY FEATURES:\n- \"Tech-savvy\" or \"modern tech\" priorities:\n  1. Twiist: Apple Watch bolusing, emoji dosing, phone-first\n  2. Tandem Mobi: Wireless charging, iPhone control\n  3. t:slim X2: Touchscreen, multiple CGM options\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nTake a look at the pump data and then the sliders and the personal preferences. The personal preferences are very pump specific and you need to rank those pumps higher on the list for the user. Also put what they say in text higher on the list - process their exact words carefully.\n\nANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:\n1. **Personal Preferences (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**: If user selected specific features, heavily favor the pump that has those exact features. Each selected feature directly maps to a specific pump.\n2. **User Text (SECOND PRIORITY)**: Analyze what the user wrote about their needs, lifestyle, concerns. Parse for keywords like \"lightest\", \"lowest target\", \"tightest control\" and apply the CRITICAL DECISION RULES above.\n3. **Slider Analysis (SUPPORTING)**: Use slider values to understand user's lifestyle and preferences to validate pump choice.\n\nIMPORTANT: When multiple priorities conflict (e.g., \"lightest with tightest control\"), explain the tradeoff:\n- Twiist is lightest (2 oz) with lowest target (87 mg/dL)\n- Medtronic 780G has most aggressive algorithm (100% correction) but heavier\n- Make recommendation based on which priority seems PRIMARY in their
