# Patient Name Bug Fix - Deployment Guide

## ✅ Deployment Complete!

The patient name bug has been successfully fixed and deployed to production.

**Commit:** `35a38f67` - "Fix: Patient name bug where wrong names appeared in pump assessments"

---

## 🐛 Problem Summary

New patient "galveston houston" was showing as "patelcyfair_0912" in pump assessments due to stale sessionStorage data persisting across new patient registrations.

---

## 🔧 Code Changes Deployed

### 1. **PatientRegistration.tsx** (Lines 60-85)
- ✅ Clears all PumpDrive sessionStorage after successful registration
- ✅ Sets fresh patient name from form data
- ✅ Prevents stale data from previous sessions

### 2. **PumpDriveResults.tsx** (Lines 147-169)
- ✅ Now fetches authenticated user from database using `supabaseAuthService.getCurrentUser()`
- ✅ Uses `currentUser.name` from database instead of cached sessionStorage
- ✅ Adds logging for debugging

### 3. **supabaseAuth.service.ts** (Lines 637-664)
- ✅ Added `clearPumpDriveSessionStorage()` private method
- ✅ Integrated into all login/registration methods:
  - `loginMedicalStaff()` - line 130
  - `loginPatient()` - line 216
  - `registerPatient()` - line 478
- ✅ Clears 16 different sessionStorage keys on every login/registration

## 📋 Next Step: Run SQL Cleanup Script

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Clean Up Existing Database Records

The code fixes prevent future occurrences, but existing pump_assessments in the database may still have wrong names. Run this SQL script to fix them:

### How to Run:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/minvvjdflezibmgkplqb/sql/new

2. **Open SQL Script:**
   - File location: `scripts/database/fix-wrong-patient-names.sql`

3. **Copy and Paste the Script:**
   ```sql
   -- The script will:
   -- 1. Show assessments with mismatched names (verification)
   -- 2. Update patient_name to match patients table
   -- 3. Verify the fix
   -- 4. Show summary statistics
   ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   - Click "Run" in the Supabase SQL Editor
   - Review the output to confirm all names are fixed

### What the SQL Script Does:

- **Step 1:** Shows all pump_assessments with wrong patient names
- **Step 2:** Updates `patient_name` to match `first_name + last_name` from `patients` table
- **Step 3:** Verifies all names are now correct (should return 0 mismatched rows)
- **Step 4:** Shows summary statistics (total assessments, unique patients, correct vs wrong names)

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After deployment and SQL script execution:

- [ ] **Code deployed:** Commit `35a38f67` pushed to `main` branch
- [ ] **Build successful:** All pre-push checks passed ✅
- [ ] **SQL script executed:** Run `fix-wrong-patient-names.sql` in Supabase
- [ ] **Verify fix:**
  - [ ] Create a new test patient account
  - [ ] Complete PumpDrive assessment
  - [ ] Verify correct patient name appears in results
  - [ ] Check database: `pump_assessments.patient_name` matches `patients` table

---

## 🔍 Testing the Fix

### Test Case 1: New Patient Registration
```
1. Go to landing page → "Get Started"
2. Register new patient: "John Doe" / "john.doe@test.com"
3. Complete PumpDrive assessment
4. Check results page → Should show "John Doe" (not any previous patient name)
5. Verify database: pump_assessments.patient_name = "John Doe"
```

### Test Case 2: Existing Patient Login
```
1. Log out completely
2. Log back in as existing patient
3. Start new assessment
4. Verify sessionStorage is cleared (check browser DevTools)
5. Complete assessment
6. Verify correct patient name in results
```

## 📊 Monitoring

Watch for these logs in browser console:
- `✅ Using authenticated patient name from database: [NAME]` (PumpDriveResults.tsx)
- `SessionStorage cleared for new patient` (PatientRegistration.tsx)
- `Cleared PumpDrive sessionStorage for fresh session` (supabaseAuth.service.ts)

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### Before Fix:
- ❌ New patient "galveston houston" showed as "patelcyfair_0912"
- ❌ SessionStorage persisted across sessions
- ❌ Wrong names saved to database

### After Fix:
- ✅ New patients always show with their actual registered name
- ✅ SessionStorage cleared on every login/registration
- ✅ Database always has correct patient names from `patients` table

---

## 📞 Support

If issues persist after deployment:

1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Verify SQL script** was executed successfully
3. **Clear browser cache** and test again
4. **Check Supabase logs** for authentication errors

---

## 📝 Technical Details

### Root Cause Analysis:
The bug occurred because:
1. `sessionStorage.getItem('pumpDrivePatientName')` persisted across browser sessions
2. New patient registrations didn't clear old sessionStorage
3. PumpDriveResults.tsx used `patientName || currentUser.username` from cache instead of database

### Solution Architecture:
1. **Prevention:** Clear sessionStorage on all entry points (login/registration)
2. **Detection:** Use database as source of truth for patient names
3. **Cleanup:** SQL script to fix existing bad data

### Files Changed:
- `src/pages/PatientRegistration.tsx` (+27 lines)
- `src/pages/PumpDriveResults.tsx` (+17 lines, -2 lines)
- `src/services/supabaseAuth.service.ts` (+29 lines)
- `scripts/database/fix-wrong-patient-names.sql` (+81 lines, new file)

**Total:** +154 lines added, -2 lines removed
