### Scoring Breakdown

```
Final Score Calculation:

Baseline:              40%   (all pumps start equal)
+ Slider Preferences:  ±12%  (user's stated preferences)
+ Feature Requirements: ±8%   (must-haves met/not met)
+ AI Free Text:        +25%  (semantic intent understanding)
+ Context 7:           ±5%   (follow-up questions) [Coming Soon]
+ Final AI Reasoning:  +20%  (holistic evaluation)
─────────────────────────────
Maximum Possible:      110%  → Capped at 100%
```

### Why This Works

**Equal Starting Point:** All pumps begin at 40% to prevent bias

**User Preferences Matter:** Sliders account for 12% - what user says they want

**Requirements Are Binary:** Features are deal-breakers (±8%)

**Intent Is Key:** AI free text gets highest weight (25%) because it captures true needs

**Context Refines:** Follow-up questions polish the recommendation (5%)

**AI Validates:** Final reasoning ensures logical, personalized choice (20%)

## AI Implementation

### Stage 4: Semantic Analysis (GPT-4o-mini)

**Prompt Template:**
```
You are analyzing patient input for insulin pump recommendations.

Patient Input: "{user_free_text}"

Pump Dimensions: {23_dimensions_json}

Analyze the patient's lifestyle, concerns, and needs. For each dimension,
determine if the patient's input suggests a preference. Return JSON with
dimension_id and relevance_score (0-1).

Focus on INTENT, not just keywords. For example:
- "I love swimming" → water_resistance dimension
- "Tired of counting carbs" → automation_behavior dimension
- "For my teenager" → pediatric_features + data_sharing dimensions
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "dimensions": [
    {"dimension_id": "water_resistance", "score": 0.9, "reason": "Swimming mentioned"},
    {"dimension_id": "automation_behavior", "score": 0.8, "reason": "Wants hands-off approach"}
  ],
  "boost": 25
}
```

### Stage 6: Final Reasoning (GPT-4o)

**Prompt Template:**
```
Based on all assessment data, recommend the best insulin pump.

Patient Profile:
- Sliders: {slider_data}
- Features: {feature_data}
- Free Text: {free_text}
- Current Scores: {current_scores}

Pumps:
1. Medtronic 780G (score: X%)
2. Tandem t:slim X2 (score: Y%)
... (all 6 pumps)

Provide:
1. Top recommendation with confidence level
2. Why it's the best fit (2-3 sentences)
3. Any important trade-offs to consider
4. Final score adjustment (0-20%)
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "recommendation": "Tandem Mobi",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Perfect for your need for discretion and iPhone control...",
  "tradeoffs": "Smaller reservoir means more frequent refills",
  "boost": 20
}
```
