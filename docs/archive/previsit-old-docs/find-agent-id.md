# How to Find Your ElevenLabs Agent ID

## Step 1: Click on "Patient intake" in your agents list

## Step 2: Look for the Agent ID in one of these places:

### Option A: In the agent details page
- Look for a field labeled "Agent ID" or "ID"
- It will look like: `agent_xxxxxxxxxx`

### Option B: In the URL
- When you click on the agent, check your browser's address bar
- The URL might look like:
  `https://elevenlabs.io/conversational-ai/agents/agent_xxxxxxxxxx`
- The part after `/agents/` is your Agent ID

### Option C: In the Settings or Configure tab
- Click "Settings" or "Configure" 
- Look for "Agent ID" or "Identifier"

## Step 3: Copy the entire ID

It should start with `agent_` followed by random letters/numbers.

Example: `agent_abc123xyz456def789`

## Step 4: Paste it back to me!

Once you have it, just paste it in the chat and I'll configure everything automatically.
