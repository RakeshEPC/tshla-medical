- [ ] Welcome back card views
- [ ] Feedback submissions
- [ ] Conflict detections
- [ ] Auto-save success rate

**Track in Analytics Dashboard or localStorage**

### First 24 Hours:
Daily review:

- [ ] Total assessments started
- [ ] Total assessments completed
- [ ] Completion rate percentage
- [ ] Feedback collection rate
- [ ] Average session duration
- [ ] Return user rate
- [ ] Error count

**Goal**: Completion rate trending upward from 30% baseline

---

### First 7 Days:
Weekly metrics:

| Metric | Baseline | Day 1 | Day 3 | Day 7 | Target |
|--------|----------|-------|-------|-------|--------|

```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.getItem('pump_session_[userId]')
```

---

### Issue: Auto-save not working

console.log(result)
```

---

### Issue: Conflicts not detected

**Check**:
1. Slider values are extreme (1-3 or 8-10)
