## 🎯 Objectives

Clean up the TSHLA Medical codebase to improve maintainability, reduce confusion, and establish clear organizational structure.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Documentation Reorganization ✅

**Problem:** 95+ markdown files scattered in root directory causing confusion

**Solution:**
- Created organized `docs/` structure
- Moved 80+ historical docs to `docs/archive/`
- Created comprehensive new documentation:
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system architecture guide
  - `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Production deployment instructions
  - `docs/PUMPDRIVE.md` - AI pump recommendation system docs
  - Updated `README.md` - Clear, professional project overview

**Files Archived:**
```
ADMIN_*.md (6 files)
BUGFIX_*.md (3 files)
DEPLOYMENT_*.md (12 files)
PUMP*.md (8 files)
SESSION_*.md (3 files)
SUPABASE_*.md (6 files)
CONTEXT7_*.md (3 files)
And 40+ more historical docs
```

**Result:** Root directory now has only essential docs (README, DEV_GUIDE, QUICK_START_GUIDE, DEPLOY, SERVER-MANAGEMENT)

### 2. Scripts Organization ✅

**Problem:** SQL files, test scripts, and deployment scripts scattered in root

**Solution:**
- Created `scripts/database/` for all SQL and database-related scripts
- Created `scripts/deployment/` for deployment scripts
- Moved 20+ SQL files to organized location
- Moved deployment scripts (azure-deploy.sh, deploy*.sh)

**Files Moved:**
- All `.sql` files → `scripts/database/`
- All `.cjs` database scripts → `scripts/database/`
- `azure-deploy.sh`, `deploy*.sh` → `scripts/deployment/`

**Result:** Clean root directory with organized scripts structure

### 3. Deprecated Service Cleanup ✅

**Problem:** Old Azure and AWS service files no longer used but cluttering codebase

**Solution:**
- Created `src/services/_deprecated/` folder
- Moved 8 deprecated services:
  - `azureOpenAI.service.ts` (now using OpenAI direct)
  - `azureAI.service.ts` (deprecated)
  - `azureSpeech.service.ts` (now using Deepgram)
  - `azureSpeechConfig.service.ts`
  - `azureSpeechStreamingFixed.service.ts`
  - `awsTranscribe.service.ts` (now using Deepgram)
  - `awsTranscribeMedicalStreamingFixed.service.ts`
  - `awsTranscribeSimple.service.ts`

**Code Updates:**
- Updated `speechServiceRouter.service.ts`:
  - Removed AWS/Azure fallback logic
  - Simplified to Deepgram-only (primary + adapter)
  - Clearer error messages
  - Removed unused provider switching code

**Result:** Clean services directory with only active services

### 4. Environment Configuration Cleanup ✅

**Problem:** Multiple `.env` files with outdated/deprecated variables

**Solution:**
- Removed duplicate env files:
  - Deleted `.env.development` (use `.env` instead)
  - Deleted `.env.unified` (consolidated)
  - Deleted `.env.production` (use `.env` for all)

- Completely rewrote `.env.example`:
  - Clear sections with headers
  - Only active variables included
  - Removed AWS Bedrock references
  - Removed Azure MySQL references
  - Removed Azure OpenAI references
  - Added clear comments and instructions
  - Documented legacy variables at bottom

**New .env Structure:**
```bash
✅ API URLs
✅ Supabase Configuration
✅ OpenAI Configuration
✅ Deepgram Configuration
✅ Security & Session Management
✅ Feature Flags
✅ Stripe (optional)
✅ Email Delivery (optional)
✅ Production Settings
📝 Legacy/Deprecated (documented for reference)
```

**Result:** Single, clear `.env.example` template with only relevant variables

#### `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (400+ lines)
- Complete tech stack overview
- System components breakdown
- Database schema documentation
- API architecture
- Security features
