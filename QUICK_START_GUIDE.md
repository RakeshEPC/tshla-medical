## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Assessment Creation**
   ```bash
   # Register test user
   curl -X POST "https://tshla-pump-api-container.redpebble-e4551b7a.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/api/auth/register" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!","username":"testuser"}'

   # Complete assessment via web UI
   # Go to https://www.tshla.ai/pumpdrive/assessment
   # Answer questions and submit
   ```

### Automated Testing (Future)

```typescript
// Example Jest tests to add later
describe('AssessmentHistory', () => {
  it('should render timeline view by default', () => {});
  it('should allow selecting up to 3 assessments', () => {});
  it('should calculate comparison insights correctly', () => {});
  it('should show empty state when no assessments', () => {});
});
```

## 📚 Documentation

### User-Facing Documentation

**Assessment History Guide**:
1. What is Assessment History?
2. How to view past assessments
3. How to compare assessments
4. How to email results to provider
5. Understanding match scores

### Developer Documentation

**Architecture**:
- Service layer pattern (assessmentHistory.service.ts)
- Component composition (AssessmentDataViewer + AssessmentHistory)
- API design (RESTful endpoints with JWT auth)
- Database schema (pump_assessments table)

**Security**:
- JWT token authentication
- User ownership verification
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- HTTPS only for email transmission

**Performance**:
- Lazy loading with React.lazy()
- Database query optimization (indexes on user_id, created_at)
- Efficient comparison algorithm (O(n) complexity)
- Responsive images and assets

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Assessment data not loading"**
- Check JWT token is valid (localStorage.getItem('pumpdriveToken'))
- Verify user is logged in
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify database connection

**Issue: "Email not sending"**
- Check SendGrid/SMTP credentials
- Verify provider email format is valid
- Check server logs for errors
- Ensure `provider_deliveries` table exists

**Issue: "History page shows empty state but I have assessments"**
- Check authentication status
- Verify assessments belong to logged-in user
- Check database connection
- Review browser console errors

**Issue: "Comparison mode not working"**
- Ensure at least 2 assessments selected
- Maximum 3 can be selected at once
- Check checkbox state management
- Review React component state

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check database tables
node scripts/check-azure-tables.cjs

# Verify access logs
node scripts/verify-access-logs.cjs

# Check API health
curl https://tshla-pump-api-container.redpebble-e4551b7a.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/api/health

# View container logs
az containerapp logs show \
  --name tshla-pump-api-container \
  --resource-group tshla-backend-rg \
  --tail 50

# Check assessment count for user
# (Run in Azure Portal Query Editor)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pump_assessments WHERE user_id = 1;
```
