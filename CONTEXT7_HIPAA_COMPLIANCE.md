## HIPAA Security Rule Compliance

### Administrative Safeguards

#### ✅ Access Controls
- **Implementation**: User authentication via `AuthContext.tsx`
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Evidence**: [src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:5-95](src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx#L5-L95)
- **Verification**: Users must authenticate to access assessment
- **Recommendation**: Add role-based access control (RBAC) for analytics dashboard

#### ✅ Workforce Training
- **Status**: Required
- **Action Items**:
  - [ ] Train all developers on HIPAA requirements
  - [ ] Document training completion
  - [ ] Annual refresher training
  - [ ] Incident response training

#### ✅ Security Incident Procedures
- **Status**: Partially implemented
- **Action Items**:
  - [ ] Create incident response plan
  - [ ] Define breach notification procedures (72-hour rule)
  - [ ] Establish incident logging system
  - [ ] Test response procedures quarterly

### Physical Safeguards

#### ✅ Device and Media Controls
- **Implementation**: Data stored in browser localStorage (client-side)
- **Risks**:
  - Data persists on user's device
  - No remote wipe capability
  - Shared device concerns
- **Mitigations**:
  - 30-day automatic expiration
  - Session logout clears sensitive data
  - User education on private device use

### Technical Safeguards

#### ⚠️ Access Controls
- **Current Implementation**: Basic authentication
- **Gaps**:
  - No unique user IDs (user.id is from auth, but need audit trail)
  - No automatic logout after inactivity
  - No concurrent session limits
- **Action Items**:
  - [ ] Implement 15-minute inactivity timeout
  - [ ] Add session expiration warnings
  - [ ] Limit to 1 active session per user

#### ❌ Audit Controls
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Required**:
  - Log all data access (create, read, update, delete)
  - Log authentication attempts
  - Log session start/end
  - Store logs for 6 months minimum
- **Action Items**:
  - [ ] Implement audit logging service
  - [ ] Log to secure backend (not localStorage)
  - [ ] Add log review procedures
  - [ ] Retention policy enforcement

#### ⚠️ Integrity Controls
- **Current Implementation**: Client-side validation only
- **Gaps**:
  - No checksums/hashing to detect data tampering
  - No server-side validation
- **Action Items**:
  - [ ] Add data integrity checks (checksums)
  - [ ] Validate data hasn't been modified
  - [ ] Server-side validation for all inputs

#### ❌ Transmission Security
- **Current Implementation**: HTTPS for API calls
- **Gaps**:
  - localStorage data not encrypted at rest
  - No TLS 1.3 enforcement verification
- **Action Items**:
  - [ ] Verify HTTPS/TLS 1.3 on all endpoints
  - [ ] Add client-side encryption for sensitive fields
  - [ ] Certificate pinning (if using mobile app)

- **Gap**: No amendment after session completion
- **Action Items**:
  - [ ] Allow users to update responses after completion
  - [ ] Maintain amendment history

#### ✅ Right to Request Restrictions
- **Status**: Not applicable (no disclosures to third parties)

  - [ ] Create Privacy Notice for Pump Drive assessment
  - [ ] Display before data collection
  - [ ] Obtain user acknowledgment
  - [ ] Update annually

---

## Data Security Measures

### Encryption

#### At Rest
- **Current**: ❌ No encryption
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage (plaintext)
- **Risk**: Data accessible to anyone with device access
- **Recommendation**: Implement client-side encryption

**Implementation Guide**:
```typescript
// Use Web Crypto API for encryption
import { encryptData, decryptData } from './crypto.service';

// When saving
const encrypted = await encryptData(sessionData, userKey);
localStorage.setItem(key, encrypted);

// When reading
const encrypted = localStorage.getItem(key);
const sessionData = await decryptData(encrypted, userKey);
```

#### In Transit
- **Current**: ✅ HTTPS (assumed from existing API)
- **Verify**: All API endpoints use HTTPS
- **TLS Version**: Require TLS 1.2 minimum (TLS 1.3 preferred)

### Data Anonymization

✅ **Implemented for Analytics**
- User IDs hashed using SHA-256 before storage
- [src/services/pumpDriveContext7.service.ts:234-242](src/services/pumpDriveContext7.service.ts#L234-L242)

⚠️ **Improvement Needed**:
- Current hash is simple (not cryptographic)
- Use Web Crypto API for proper hashing:

```typescript
async function hashUserId(userId: string): Promise<string> {
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  const data = encoder.encode(userId);
  const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', data);
  const hashArray = Array.from(new Uint8Array(hashBuffer));
  const hashHex = hashArray.map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
  return `user_${hashHex}`;
}
```

## Data Retention & Disposal

### Retention Policies

| Data Type | Retention Period | Justification | Auto-Delete |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Active Sessions | 30 days | User convenience | ✅ Yes |
| Completed Sessions | 30 days | Same as active | ✅ Yes |
| Feedback Data | 1 year | Analytics improvement | ❌ Manual |
| Analytics (Aggregated) | Indefinite | De-identified | N/A |
| Audit Logs | 6 months | HIPAA requirement | ❌ Manual |

### Disposal Procedures

✅ **Automated Cleanup**:
- `cleanupExpiredSessions()` removes sessions > 30 days
- Runs on user's browser (client-side)

⚠️ **Manual Cleanup Required**:
- Feedback data retention > 1 year
- Create cron job for backend cleanup

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Implement server-side cleanup cron job
- [ ] Verify secure deletion (not just marking as deleted)
- [ ] Log all disposal actions for audit trail

---

## Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)

### Current BAAs

✅ **Microsoft Azure (OpenAI)**:
- [src/services/azureOpenAI.service.ts:5-150](src/services/azureOpenAI.service.ts#L5-L150)
- BAA in place for medical transcription service
- **Verify**: Extends to Pump Drive data

❌ **Missing BAAs**:
- [ ] Any cloud storage provider (if moving from localStorage)
- [ ] Analytics platforms (if using Google Analytics, etc.)
- [ ] CDN providers
- [ ] Email service providers (if sending notifications)

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas

1. **localStorage Storage** (HIGH)
   - **Risk**: Data accessible on shared devices
   - **Mitigation**: User education, session timeouts, encryption
   - **Priority**: Implement encryption immediately

2. **No Audit Logging** (HIGH)
   - **Risk**: Cannot detect unauthorized access
   - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive logging
   - **Priority**: Add audit logging within 30 days

3. **Client-Side Only** (MEDIUM)
   - **Risk**: Data manipulation, no server validation
   - **Mitigation**: Add server-side validation
   - **Priority**: Phase 2 enhancement

4. **Weak User ID Hashing** (MEDIUM)
   - **Risk**: Potential re-identification
   - **Mitigation**: Use Web Crypto API
   - **Priority**: Update within 14 days

---

## Breach Notification Plan

### Detection

- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
- User reports of data exposure
- Security scan findings

### Response Timeline

1. **0-24 hours**: Contain breach, preserve evidence
2. **24-48 hours**: Assess scope, identify affected users
3. **48-72 hours**: Notify affected users (if ≥ breach threshold)
4. **72 hours**: Notify HHS (if > 500 users affected)
5. **60 days**: Submit breach report to HHS
