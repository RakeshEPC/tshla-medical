## How to Use (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Disable Email Verification (Required First!)

**Why:** So users can log in immediately without clicking email link

**How:**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select project: `minvvjdflezibmgkplqb`
3. Authentication → Settings → Email Auth
4. Turn OFF "Enable email confirmations"
5. Click Save

**See:** `DISABLE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION.md` for detailed instructions

### Step 2: Access Admin Page

**Local Development:**
```bash
# If app is running
http://localhost:5173/admin/create-accounts
```

**Production:**
```
https://mango-sky-0ba265c0f.1.azurestaticapps.net/admin/create-accounts
```

### Step 3: Create Your First Staff Account

1. Select "Medical Staff" tab
2. Fill in:
   - First Name: Your first name
   - Last Name: Your last name
   - Email: your-email@clinic.com
   - Click "Generate" for password (or enter your own)
   - Role: Doctor (or Admin, Nurse, Staff)
   - Specialty: (optional)
   - Practice: Your clinic name
3. Click "Create Staff Account"
4. **SAVE THE PASSWORD** - appears in green box on right side
5. Staff can now log in at `/login`

### Step 4: Create Patient Accounts

1. Select "Patient" tab
2. Fill in patient details
3. Check/uncheck "Enable PumpDrive" based on if they need pump recommendations
4. Click "Create Patient Account"
5. **SAVE THE PASSWORD** - give it to the patient
6. Patient can log in at `/login`

## What Each Account Type Can Do

### Medical Staff
- ✅ Use dictation for clinical notes
- ✅ Generate SOAP notes with AI
- ✅ View/manage patients
- ✅ Create/edit templates (per-user, not shared)
- ✅ View patient charts and visit history
- ✅ Access admin features (if role = admin)

### Patients (Without PumpDrive)
- ✅ View their own medical records
- ✅ Request refills, lab orders
- ✅ Book appointments
- ✅ View visit history
- ❌ No access to PumpDrive assessments

### Patients (With PumpDrive Enabled)
- ✅ Everything above PLUS:
- ✅ Take insulin pump assessments
- ✅ Get AI-powered pump recommendations
- ✅ View assessment history
- ✅ Export assessment reports

## Templates Are Per-User (Already Working!)

**Good News:** The database is already set up correctly!

From `master-schema.sql`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE templates (
  doctor_id UUID REFERENCES medical_staff(id),  -- Per-user!
  is_shared BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
  ...
)
```

**What This Means:**
- Each staff member has their own templates
- Template edits only save to that user's account
- Templates are NOT global (unless you set is_shared = true)
- Each user's template library is isolated

**No changes needed** - this already works!

## Testing Checklist

After you disable email verification, test these:

### Test 1: Create Staff Account
```
☐ Go to /admin/create-accounts
☐ Create staff account
☐ Copy the password
☐ Log out
☐ Log in with new staff credentials
☐ Verify you can access dictation
☐ Verify you can create a template
```

### Test 2: Create Patient Account (No PumpDrive)
```
☐ Create patient account (uncheck PumpDrive)
☐ Log out
☐ Log in with patient credentials
☐ Verify patient dashboard shows
☐ Verify no access to PumpDrive
```

### Test 3: Create Patient Account (With PumpDrive)
```
☐ Create patient account (check PumpDrive)
☐ Log out
☐ Log in with patient credentials
☐ Verify access to /pumpdrive page
☐ Start an assessment
☐ Verify it saves to database
```

### Test 4: Template Isolation
```
☐ Log in as Staff User #1
☐ Create a template
☐ Log out
☐ Log in as Staff User #2
☐ Verify Staff User #2 does NOT see Staff User #1's template
☐ ✅ Templates are per-user!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Account created but user cannot log in"
**Cause:** Email verification is still enabled
**Fix:** Follow `DISABLE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION.md`

### Issue: "Failed to create medical staff profile"
**Possible causes:**
1. Email already exists (try different email)
2. Supabase RLS policy blocking
3. Database connection issue

**Check:**
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
- See if user was created in auth.users
- Check if medical_staff or patients table has matching record

### Issue: "Row Level Security policy violation"
**Possible cause:** RLS policies may need adjustment

**Quick fix for testing:**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor (TEMPORARY for testing)
ALTER TABLE medical_staff DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE patients DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Re-enable later once testing complete
ALTER TABLE medical_staff ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE patients ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Issue: "User profile not found" after login
**Cause:** Auth user created but medical_staff/patients record missing

**Fix:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor
2. Find medical_staff or patients table
3. Check if record exists with matching auth_user_id
4. If missing, delete auth user and recreate account
